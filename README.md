# Simple Exploit for Verification of CVE-2015-6606

This is a simple exploit to verify a code injection vulnerability that exists in the
SEEK smartcard service versions 3.1.0 and below (CVE-2015-6606, Google internal bug#
ANDROID-22301786). The vulnerability allows specially crafted Android application
packages to inject arbitrary code into the execution context of the smartcard system
service. This code inherits all permissions granted to this system service, which
include signature-or-system permissions that are not normally granted to third party
apps.

Further details can be found in our report *Executing Arbitrary Code in the Context
of the Smartcard System Service* (see literature section below).
